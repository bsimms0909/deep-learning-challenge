### Report on the Neural Network Model

## Analysis Overview
The aim of our analysis was to utilize computers for predicting the success of fundraising campaigns for Alphabet Soup. We explored three distinct approaches employing deep learning techniques. Initially, we curated and refined our dataset, eliminating extraneous information. Subsequently, we partitioned the data into training and testing sets to facilitate computer learning. Additionally, we optimized the data for enhanced comprehension by the computer, specifying the prediction task and relevant input features such as fundraising amounts.

## Results

## Model 1 (Method 1):
Used  the "Adam" method for training over 100 rounds.
Comprised of two layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively.
Performance: Loss of 0.5564, Accuracy of 0.7257.- highest accuracy.

## Model 2 (Method 2):
Used the "RMSprop" method for training across 100 rounds.
Incorporated more layers and neurons compared to Model 1.
Performance: Loss of 0.5566, Accuracy of 0.7252.

## Model 3 (Method 3):
Used the "Nadam" method and was trained for 50 rounds.
Performance was notably inferior.
Performance: Loss of 0.6876, Accuracy of 0.4833.

##Summary
Models 1 and 2 demonstrated similar performance, effectively predicting campaign success, while Model 3 exhibited unsatisfactory results.

## Recommendations
Considering a different approach might yield better outcomes for this task. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in handling specific data types such as images or sequences, potentially enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, exploring alternative techniques or leveraging transfer learning could further optimize model performance.
